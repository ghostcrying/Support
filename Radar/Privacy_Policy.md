# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 3, 2026**

## Introduction

Global Economy Radar ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.** Global Economy Radar is designed with privacy as a core principle. Specifically, we do not:

- Collect personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Collect location data
- Collect device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Track user behavior or app usage patterns
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Require user accounts or registration

## Data Displayed in the App

The App displays publicly available economic data obtained from the World Bank API. This data includes:

- Country names and codes
- Economic indicators (GDP, inflation rates, GDP per capita)
- Currency information
- Regional classifications

All data displayed is publicly available information and does not constitute personal information.

## Local Data Storage

The App stores economic data locally on your device using Core Data. This local storage:

- Enables offline access to previously downloaded data
- Improves app performance by reducing network requests
- Does not include any personal information
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the App

## Network Activity

The App connects to the World Bank API to retrieve economic data. This connection:

- Only requests publicly available economic statistics
- Does not transmit any user information
- Does not include user identifiers in API requests
- Uses standard HTTPS encryption for data transmission

## Third-Party Services

**World Bank API**
The App retrieves data from the World Bank API (https://api.worldbank.org). The World Bank's privacy policy governs their data practices. We do not share any user information with the World Bank.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, this is not applicable, but we want to make our commitment clear.

## Data Security

While we do not collect personal information, we implement appropriate technical measures to protect the App and data transmission:

- All network communications use HTTPS encryption
- Data is stored securely on your device using iOS security features
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we have no servers)

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. You can:

- Delete the App at any time, which will remove all locally stored data
- Stop using the App without any data retention concerns
- Contact us with privacy-related questions (see Contact section)

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the App Store listing

Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect personal information, there is no personal data to retain. Economic data stored locally on your device remains until you delete the App.

## International Users

The App is available internationally. Economic data displayed is publicly available information from the World Bank and does not vary based on user location.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us through the App Store support channels.

## Compliance

This Privacy Policy complies with:
- Apple App Store Privacy Guidelines
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requirements
- Other applicable privacy laws

## Summary

**In simple terms:** Global Economy Radar does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The App only displays publicly available economic data and stores this data locally on your device for offline access. Your privacy is fully protected.
